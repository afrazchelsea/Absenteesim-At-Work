# Predicting-Absenteesim-At-Work
Project Done by Afrazahmed Momin as a part of the "Data Science Internship" by TechSmart Systems

## Problem Description

XYZ is a courier company. As we appreciate that human capital plays an important role in collection, transportation and delivery. The company is passing through genuine issue of Absenteeism. The company has shared it dataset and requested to have an answer on the following areas:

1 . What changes company should bring to reduce the number of absenteeism? 

2 . How much losses every month can we project in 2011 if same trend of absenteeism continues? 

## Data
Our task is to build a regression model which will predict the absentieesm in hours based on the employee attributes and information. We will approach it as a Regression Problem.

## Performance Metric
### RMSE : 

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are, RMSE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit. 

## Step by Step Approach
EDA -> Data Visualization -> Dimension Reduction -> Sampling -> Model Selection -> Model Inference

## Algorithms Used
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor
